# SeoAnalysis

A Search Engine Results Page (SERP) Analyser tool.

This tool attempts to retrieve all results (not including sub-results) from a Google keywords search, match a specified domain name, 
and return a list of result positions where the match occurred. This would be the equivalent to matching all of the green links on Google's
 search results page.
